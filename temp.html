            Convenience.
        </p>
        <p>In today’s fast-paced society, the less you have to worry about, the better. Right? Convenience is
            another primary selling point of home automation devices, which virtually eliminate small hassles
            such as turning the lights off before you go to bed or adjusting the thermostat when you wake
            up in the morning. Many systems come with remote dashboard capabilities, so forgetting to turn
            off that coffee pot before you leave no longer requires a trip back to the house. Simply pull
            up the dashboard on a smart device or computer, and turn the coffee pot off in a matter of seconds.</p>

            Energy Savings.
        </p>

        <p>
            Home automation systems have definitely proven themselves in the arena of energy efficiency. Automated thermostats allow
            you to pre-program temperatures based on the time of day and the day of the week. And some even
            adjust to your behaviors, learning and adapting to your temperature preferences without your
            ever inputting a pre-selected schedule. Traditional or behavior-based automation can also be
            applied to virtually every gadget that can be remotely controlled – from sprinkler systems to
            coffee makers. Actual energy savings ultimately depend on the type of device you select and its
            automation capabilities. But on average, product manufacturers estimate the systems can help
            consumers save anywhere from 10 to 15 percent off of heating and cooling bills.

            Security
        </p>
        <p>
            Remote monitoring can put your mind at ease while you’re away from the house. With remote dashboards, lights and lamps can
            be turned on and off, and automated blinds can be raised and lowered. These capabilities – combined
            with automated security systems – can help you mitigate the risks of intrusions: you will be
            alerted immediately if something uncharacteristic happens.

            Installation Costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Depending on the complexity of the system, installing a home automation device can be a significant burden on the homeowner.
            It can either cost you money if you hire an outside contractor or cost you time if you venture
            to do it yourself.

            Complex Technology
        </p>
        <p>
            Automating everything in life may sound extremely appealing, but sometimes a good old-fashioned flip of the switch is a lot
            easier than reaching for your smart phone to turn lights on and off. Before you decide which
            system is right for you, think about how far you really want to take home automation in your
            household.

        <p>System Compatibility</p>
        <p>
            Controlling all aspects of home automation from one centralized platform is important, but not all systems are compatible
            with one another. Your security system, for example, may require you to log in to one location
            to manage settings, while your smart thermostat may require you to log in to another platform
            to turn the air conditioner on and off. To truly leverage the convenience of home automation,
            you may need to invest in centralized platform technology to control all systems and devices
            from one location.
