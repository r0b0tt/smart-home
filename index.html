                        A smart home is one in which the various electric and electronic appliances are wired up to a central computer control system
                        so they can either be switched on and off at certain times (for example, heating can be set to come
                        on automatically at 6:00AM on winter mornings) or if certain events happen (lights can be set to
                        come on only when a photoelectric sensor detects that it's dark). A plug-in Smiths time switch for
                        controlling ordinary home appliances. Most homes already have a certain amount of "smartness" because
                        many appliances already contain built-in sensors or electronic controllers. Virtually all modern
                        washing machines have programmers that make them follow a distinct series of washes, rinses, and
                        spins depending on how you set their various dials and knobs when you first switch on. If you have
                        a natural-gas-powered central heating system, most likely you also have a thermostat on the wall
                        that switches it on and off according to the room temperature, or an electronic programmer that activates
                        it at certain times of day whether or not you're in the house. Maybe you're really hi-tech and you
                        have a robotic vacuum cleaner that constantly crawls around your floors sweeping the dust?

                        The Smart Homes will be implemented through Li-Fi technology. Li-Fi is transmission of data through illumination by sending
                        data through a LED light bulb that varies in intensity faster than the human eye can follow. LED
                        bulbs are most ideal for implementing Li-Fi since LED light bulbs can amplify light intensity and
                        switch rapidly meaning LED cells can modulate thousands of signals without the human eye ever noticing.
                        <br> Li-Fi is a Visible Light Communications (VLC) system for data transmission which will have two components:
                        <ul>
                            <li>one device with a photodiode able to receive light signals</li>
                            <li>A light source equipped with a signal processing unit.</li>
                        </ul>
                        The models used for the in-house communication will include GigaShower, GigaSpot and Giga- MIMO. A transmitter is mounted
                        into the ceiling connected to a media server. On the other side are portable or fixed devices on
                        an operating room. GigaShower will provide unidirectional data services via several channels to multiple
                        users with gigabit-class communication speed over several metres. GigaSpot and GigaMIMO are optical
                        wireless single- and multi-channel HotSpot solutions which will offer bidirectional gigabit-class
                        communication in any room.

                            The Smart Lighting System is equipped with sensitive motion detectors in that, as one moves through the rooms, lights turn
                            on ahead and fade behind. These will be sensor integrated. Meaning that, they will be able to
                            sense people and day light. One will also be able to manually control the lighting system if
                            they desire. The smart Lighting is somewhat of a delight as it sets the mood ready for a movie,
                            making the house ready for a theme party say, Christmas, the range is limitless. The bulbs to
                            be used are Phillips Hue bulbs which enables the home user to wirelessly control the intensity
                            and color of the home lighting. One is able to customize schedules, color and color combinations
                            upto 50 Hue LED LIGHTS.

                            The smart thermostat is a smart technology used in home automation to remotely control one’s home temperature remotely preferably
                            via a phone or tablet. Temperature is set on dial. The Smart Home will use two types of thermostats:
                            <li>Connected Thermostat: these will be controlled through internet connection for remote management.
                                Users will be allowed to adjust heating or cooling conditions. This is the simplest version
                                of the thermostat.</li>
                            <li>Learning Zoned Thermostat : these are more advanced and will learn when each room of the house
                                is occupied and then automatically schedule heating or cooling of a particular room.</li>
                            <br> The smart thermostat eliminates the need to constantly adjust temperature at your home especially
                            when one is too tired to do it manually. It also makes the home a conducive temperature for when
                            one arrives.

                            point of home automation devices, which virtually eliminate small hassles such as turning the
                            lights off before you go to bed or adjusting the thermostat when you wake up in the morning.
                            Many systems come with remote dashboard capabilities, so forgetting to turn off that coffee pot
                            before you leave no longer requires a trip back to the house. Simply pull up the dashboard on
                            a smart device or computer, and turn the coffee pot off in a matter of seconds.

                        <p>
                            Home automation systems have definitely proven themselves in the arena of energy efficiency. Automated thermostats allow
                            you to pre-program temperatures based on the time of day and the day of the week. And some even
                            adjust to your behaviors, learning and adapting to your temperature preferences without your
                            ever inputting a pre-selected schedule. Traditional or behavior-based automation can also be
                            applied to virtually every gadget that can be remotely controlled – from sprinkler systems to
                            coffee makers. Actual energy savings ultimately depend on the type of device you select and its
                            automation capabilities. But on average, product manufacturers estimate the systems can help
                            consumers save anywhere from 10 to 15 percent off of heating and cooling bills.

                            be turned on and off, and automated blinds can be raised and lowered. These capabilities – combined
                            with automated security systems – can help you mitigate the risks of intrusions: you will be
                            alerted immediately if something uncharacteristic happens.

                            Depending on the complexity of the system, installing a home automation device can be a significant burden on the homeowner.
                            It can either cost you money if you hire an outside contractor or cost you time if you venture
                            to do it yourself.

                            Automating everything in life may sound extremely appealing, but sometimes a good old-fashioned flip of the switch is a lot
                            easier than reaching for your smart phone to turn lights on and off. Before you decide which
                            system is right for you, think about how far you really want to take home automation in your
                            household.

                            Controlling all aspects of home automation from one centralized platform is important, but not all systems are compatible
                            with one another. Your security system, for example, may require you to log in to one location
                            to manage settings, while your smart thermostat may require you to log in to another platform
                            to turn the air conditioner on and off. To truly leverage the convenience of home automation,
                            you may need to invest in centralized platform technology to control all systems and devices
                            from one location.
